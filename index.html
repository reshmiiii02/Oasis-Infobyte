            Rani Lakshmi Bai, the Queen of Jhansi, was one of the leading figures of the Indian Rebellion of 1857.
            She was a symbol of resistance against British rule and fought bravely for India's independence. Born in
            1828, she displayed remarkable courage and leadership, inspiring generations to come.

            Her famous slogan, "Main apni Jhansi nahi dungi" (I shall not surrender my Jhansi), remains a testament
            to her determination and patriotism. She died in battle on June 18, 1858, fighting valiantly against
            British forces.
